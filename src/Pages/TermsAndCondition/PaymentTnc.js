                            <br/>
                            These are the terms and conditions (the "Terms and Conditions") for use of a bank account registered with Nes Global Solutions., or any of its affiliated companies (together “NES Global”), as a payment method for NES Global services. Please note that your use of the NES Global website is also governed by our Privacy Policy, as well as all other applicable terms, conditions, limitations and requirements contained on the NES Global website, all of which (as changed over time) are incorporated into these Terms and Conditions. If you choose to use a bank account as your payment method, you accept and agree to all NES Global Terms and Conditions.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            1.	Bank Account Payments: By choosing to use a bank account as your payment method, you will be able to complete your purchase using any valid automated clearing house ("ACH") enabled bank account at India-based financial institution. Whenever you choose to pay for an order using your bank account, you are authorizing NES Global (or its agent) to debit your bank account for the total amount of your purchase (including applicable taxes, fees and shipping costs). Your transaction must be payable in INR. NESS Global, in its sole discretion, may refuse this payment option service to anyone or any user without notice for any reason at any time.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            2.	ACH Authorization: By choosing your bank account as your payment method, you agree that: (a) you have read, understand and agree to these Terms and Conditions, and that this agreement constitutes a "writing signed by you" under any applicable law or regulation, (b) you consent to the electronic delivery of the disclosures contained in these Terms and Conditions, (c) you authorize NES Global (or its agent) to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate any dispute involving your payment, which may include ordering a credit report and performing other credit checks or verifying the information you provide against third party databases, (d) you authorize NES Global (or its agent) to initiate one or more ACH debit entries (withdrawals) or the creation of an equivalent bank draft for the specified amount(s) from your bank account, and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such payments, and (e) you authorize NES Global to debit your bank account or payment card on file, in order to settle any invoices not paid in full by the due date. You acknowledge that NES Global relies upon your ACH authorization when determining whether to provide transportation services to you. Therefore, in consideration for NES Global agreeing to rely, in whole or in part, upon your ACH authorization as a means of payment, you irrevocably authorize NES Global to debit your bank account for any changes related to any shipment that has been delivered for future shipments for which you have not accepted a quote by notifying NES Global in writing via query@nesglobal.in, provided, however such revocation shall not be effective for invoices that have already been shared with you or for foreseeable changes related to any quoted shipment at the time of your revocation. If you take any action to frustrate an ACH transaction authorized by these Terms and Conditions, then NES Global, automatically and without further notice revokes any credit terms or other payment accommodation which it may have previously afforded to you, accelerates you entire account balance, and your entire balance is immediately due and payable.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            3.	Credit Card Payments: If you authorize NES Global to charge a credit card as a method of payment (a “Credit Card Authorization”), then you authorized NES Global, in its sole discretion, to charge the credit card account for the amount shown on any and all invoices presented to you without further notice to you. All credit card transactions will include credit card processing fee equal to 3.0% of the outstanding balance paid by credit card. You acknowledge that NES Global relies upon your Credit Card Authorization when determining whether to provide transportation services to you. Therefore, in consideration for NES Global agreeing to rely, in whole or in part, upon your Credit Card Authorization as a means of payment, you irrevocably authorize NES Global to charge your credit card for any charges related to any shipment that has been delivered or that is in transit. You may revoke your Credit Card Authorization for future shipments for which you have not accepted a quote by notifying Flexport in writing via query@nesglobal.in, provided, however such revocation shall not be effective for invoices that have already been shared with you or for foreseeable charges related to any quoted shipment at the time of your revocation. If you take any action to frustrate a transaction authorized by these Terms and Conditions, then NES Global, automatically and without further notice, revokes any credit terms or other payment accommodation which it might have previously afforded to you, accelerates your entire account balance, and your entire balance is immediately due and payable.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            4.	Partial Debits and Returned Payments: If your full invoice total is not processed by us at the same time, you hereby authorize partial debits from your bank account, not to exceed the total amount of your order. If any of your payments are returned unpaid, you authorize NES Global (or its agent) to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account to collect a return fee. The return fee may be added to your payment amount and debited from your bank account if we resubmit an ACH debit due to insufficient funds. In addition to any applicable late fees or charges, any unpaid principal balance shall accrue interest at the rate of 2% per month (24% per annum), calculated monthly, commencing the day after the invoice due date, until the balance is paid. We may initiate a collection process or legal action to collect any money owed to us. You agree to pay all our costs for such action, including any reasonable attorneys' fees.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            5.	Contacting NES Global: Transactions that we process using your bank account will be identified as "NES Global" (or similar identifier) on the statement issued by your bank or other financial institution holding your account.

                            6.

We reserve the right to cancel the ability to pay by bank account for any reason at any time.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            7.	No Offsets; Notice of Disputes: Customer shall pay all freight and accessorial charges in full, without any reduction based upon an alleged offset, counterclaim or other deduction. Full payment of freight and accessorial charges shall be a condition precedent to Customer's right to assert an offset, counterclaim or other deduction. Customer must contest/dispute any freight or accessorial charges in writing by email for NES Global’s review within 30 days of its receipt of an invoice that includes the contested charges.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            8.	Credit and Payment Terms: NES Global’s standard payment terms require receipt of cash before performance of services. We may, in our sole discretion, extend credit to you. The amount and terms of credit are subject to our periodic review. NES Global may in its sole discretion increase, decrease, suspend or revoke credit at any time for any reason and without advance notice. Except to the extent we otherwise agree, NES Global has no obligation to make or incur any expense, guarantee or advance for any purpose.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>

Agreement Changes: We may in our discretion change these Terms and Conditions, other applicable terms and conditions, and/or our Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you. If any change is found to be invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that change is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any other changes or the remainder of these Terms and Conditions. We reserve the right to subcontract any of our rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions. IN THE EVENT THAT WE CHANGE THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOUR CONTINUED USE OF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT AS A PAYMENT METHOD CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH CHANGES.
